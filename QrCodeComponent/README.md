## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic **HTML5**
- **CSS** Flexbox
- Responsive design with **media queries**
- **Mobile-first workflow**

### What I Learned

This project helped me reinforce my **Flexbox layout skills** and **responsive design techniques**. Here are some key takeaways:

- Using **`flex-direction: column;`** for vertical alignment.
- Utilizing **`min()` and `clamp()`** for more dynamic responsive sizing.
- Setting up **media queries** for **375px and 1440px screens**.

Example code snippet:
```css
.qrcard {
    width: min(85%, 320px); /* Mobile-first approach */
    height: 80%;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
}
## Continued Development

In future projects, I want to:

- Explore **CSS Grid** for more complex layouts.
- Optimize **accessibility** by improving semantic HTML structure.
- Enhance **performance** by using optimized images.
